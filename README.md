# fizzbuzz
Completing the Fizzbuzz exercise from https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-problem-solving

## Brief
Write a program that takes a userâ€™s input and prints the numbers from one to the number the user entered. However, for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.

### Notes
- I decided NOT to follow the exercise instructions, as it seemed like they were doing handholding and I wanted to try and challenge myself.
- I made a basic UI because I wanted to practice DOM manipulation.
- The program also accounts for numbers less than 1 and decimals.
- I tried to practice making the code as readable as possible while minimising comments, by using named functions. It seems a bit overkill for a project of such a small scope, but I (hopefully) practised good habits.
